# Stacks and Queues

Stack is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in first-out (LIFO) principle. Queue is a container of objects (a linear collection) that are inserted and removed according to the first-in first-out (FIFO) principle.

## Challenge

Create two classes, one for stacks and one for queues with methods for each.

## Approach & Efficiency

Time O(1) for all.
