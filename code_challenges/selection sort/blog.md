# Selection Sort

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort

## Pseudo code

```
InsertionSort(int[] arr)
  
    FOR i = 1 to arr.length
    
      int j <-- i - 1
      int temp <-- arr[i]
      
      WHILE j >= 0 AND temp < arr[j]
        arr[j + 1] <-- arr[j]
        j <-- j - 1
        
      arr[j + 1] <-- temp
```
